How to deal with expr1 expr2 if no set ordering? I think that is a powerful argument in favor of making the flex ordering purely 
a visual thing, and the real ordering immutable because then any expressions based off of expr1 or expr2 dont get changed
however, if the variable name was just changed over everywhere, i guess that would work, but doesn't seem neccessary. maybe make it a 
setting?

the InputColumn idea must be revived. That will be the ultimate panel and provide the true array of inputvalues depending on which input panel is 
focused. It will be an addable panel but children will be true input panels. Thus the array of values of its children will be an array of array of values.

Maybe some processing should be done on a lower level? Maybe each input panel should have in its memory what its vars are and their relations? 
Or maybe everything should be sent as equations? As in expr1=5+4 instead of 5+4 is sent as inputvalue? yeah thats good wait hold up if the index is being
transmitted whats the need?

Alright so how is the panel situation 
how deal with error messages
easy expr1=Syntax Error
but any highlighting or anything? 
deal with it later, if global state for variable values (which will be so bc calculate.js is gonna be at app level)
then we can have conditional coloring

Panel
    state
        Array:[5+4,3lbs to Newtons,x=3]
    propsbundle
        Array[i],setArray[i]  //this must be given by the ChildManager
