    Color and Theme
      Dark Mode, Slider, theme.palette.type
      Primary Color
      Secondary Color
    Calculation
      Use physics pack slider
        f=ma slider
        mv=mv slider
        etc
      character to token ordering 
      F, I, a should all be TOKENS when being used as special meaning, cuz for example 'I' can be current or moment of inertia
  
  
  NEW IDEA
    use the material color icon to select primary and secondary color, the icon to change from dark to light mode,
    then calculator settings can be in calculator, where they belong
  
  More on TopBar:  Add a place for help, feedback and source
  
Input Box: 
  tokenization must occur on that level so the user can select whether they want F to be a new variable or force for example.

Input Panel needs to be max-height 100% and overflow scroll

use client x for resizers
